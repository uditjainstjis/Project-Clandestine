# Main Idea

AI is slowly poisoning its own well.

Right now, there are 1200+ AI-generated content sites. AI keeps pulling data from the web, but the web itself is now filled with AI-written articles. Some even throw a tiny disclaimer like "may be inaccurate," but it doesn't matter — the damage is done.

Here's the real problem:

1. AI/LLM gives wrong info →
2. Someone makes a video with that info/Publishes over reputed site →
3. Video/Blog post gets views →
4. Next AI sees that video/news as "high-engagement = must be true"→
5. That misinformation becomes a source → repeats → spreads

It just keeps looping.
A fake fact goes viral once, and suddenly it becomes "truth" everywhere because every new model reads it and accepts it. This is how an AI-driven misinformation bubble is forming.

So the opportunity is obvious:
If we build something that doesn't just fetch information but actually verifies it + proves it, that's huge.
Whoever solves verification wins.
