# Short rule-of-thumb (decide by harm/cost)

## When to Minimize False Positives (High Precision)

Minimize False Positives (High Precision) when a false alarm causes serious harm: reputational damage, legal action, wrongful takedown, costly investigation, loss of livelihood.

**Example:** flagging a legitimate news article as "fake" or blocking a bank transfer that is actually valid.

## When to Minimize False Negatives (High Recall)

Minimize False Negatives (High Recall) when missing a real positive is dangerous: health/medical diagnosis, safety-critical systems, fraud that must be caught.

**Example:** cancer detection — missing a cancer case is much worse than a follow-up test on a false alarm.
